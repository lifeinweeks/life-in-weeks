{Problem solving}

[understanding the problem]

- Make sure you fully understand the problem, you can go down the wrong rabbit hole wasting so much time and effort and feeling burnt out just because you missed a essential condition in the problem.
- Spend as much time as you need in understanding the problem, do not rush it, Meditate on it.
- Make sure you focus on test cases, understanding test cases is part of understanding the problem.
- make your own if you do't have any test cases.

[being mislead]

-  today, I encoutered a problem in which i eventually understood the problem but i was "mislead" by the test case codeforces provided [https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1372/A]
    - This might happen in real life, that's why you should think of your own test cases, preferably radically different ones.

[Fatigue or whatever]

- There are days such as the last few days where i cannot for the life of me solve any problem, this is not the first time this happened.
