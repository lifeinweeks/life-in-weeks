BEHAVE 
- Behaviour <== nervous system <== sensory stimuli <== hormones <== ....
- why did ANY behavior occur? because of some hormone; because of evolution; because of childhood experiences or genes or culture. ALL AT ONCE.
- What happened one second before ? 
    - The nervous system is at the center of what happens one seconf beofre.
- the nervous system is a bunch of cells glued together, Neuron (aka brain cells ) and galia cells (thare are about 5 for every neroun, think of them as a maid for the neurons, they store energy for them and cleanup neuronal damage)
- Neruons are destinctive and unique on their appearnce, they can be very large (many feets long) [just google it]
- what do neurons do ?
    - "What neurons do is talk to one another, cause one another to get excited."
- their anatomy
    * dendrites (ears) + body (cell body and axon) + axon terminals (Mouth)
    A neuron sends a signal(electrical or chemical) to another neuron from its axon terminals to the next neurons dendrites. 
- Neurons never reach Equilibrium, they are either positively charged(action potential) or negatively charged (resting potential).
    positively / negatively charged with what ? 
        ANSWER: This negative charge is primarily due to the differential distribution of ions such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), chloride (Cl-), and negatively charged proteins.

                        Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions are more concentrated outside the neuron.
                        Potassium (K+) ions are more concentrated inside the neuron.
                        Additionally, there are negatively charged proteins inside the neuron.
