[Anatomy of the state: Book notes] These are just interpretation of the book, not my opinions, please don't come arrest me.

- The author claims that the gov(any gov) intergrated itself deeply in society, he claims that since the gov was chosen by the people then anything the gov does is by definition "Right" because it was chosen by the majority, it was fairly chosen and what it does is for the good of society.
    - He claims that the merge of society and gov is widely believed(althoug to different degrees) and he is aware that it's (that belief) ususally brushed off
    - you'll often hear demonstrations of that belief in sentences like "We are the gov", "we owe it to ourselves" which group the gov and society as one
- There always has been a natural way to live and survive, you want / need something ? You spend time, energy and ressources to get it OR you swap something you already have that someone else wants / needs with that thing you need.
    - There is another way with which you can acquire what you need / want, you use force and take it from someone who has. that's what he claims the gov does 
    - The second unatural way of living or "acquiring wealth" is  "a political mean".
    - they quoted franz oppenhiemer to describe the state as "organization of the political means" 
    - he claims that The state "always been born in conquest and exploitation" giving example of a tribe realizing that killing the opposing tribe is not ideal because they could force that tribe to "pay tax" which is much more beneficial.
