[Anatomy of the state: Book notes] These are just interpretation of the book, not my opinions, please don't come arrest me.

- The author claims that the gov(any gov) intergrated itself deeply in society, he claims that since the gov was chosen by the people then anything the gov does is by definition "Right" because it was chosen by the majority, it was fairly chosen and what it does is for the good of society.
    - He claims that the merge of society and gov is widely believed(althoug to different degrees) and he is aware that it's (that belief) ususally brushed off
    - you'll often hear demonstrations of that belief in sentences like "We are the gov", "we owe it to ourselves" which group the gov and society as one
- There always has been a natural way to live and survive, you want / need something ? You spend time, energy and ressources to get it OR you swap something you already have that someone else wants / needs with that thing you need.
    - There is another way with which you can acquire what you need / want, you use force and take it from someone who has. that's what he claims the gov does 
    - The second unatural way of living or "acquiring wealth" is  "a political mean".
    - they quoted franz oppenhiemer to describe the state as "organization of the political means" 
    - he claims that The state "always been born in conquest and exploitation" giving example of a tribe realizing that killing the opposing tribe is not ideal because they could force that tribe to "pay tax" which is much more beneficial.
- He claims that there is a distinction between the ruling group and the "cast".
    - cast: a group with priv- ileges or burdens coercively granted or imposed by the State and the Marxian concept of “class” in society
    - the Cast seem to help the ruling group rule in exchange for prevliges
    - He notes that among other ways (force) the ruling group rules, there is the as he said "passive resignation as if to an inevitable law of nature"
    - He nots that a small minority ruling group rules the majority with the help of some out of the majority, this is consistent with the idea of "acquiring wealth trough political mean" 
    - convincing a minority to support you as a ruler is not enough, here enters ideology as he stated:
            "For this essential acceptance, the majority must be persuaded by ideology
                that their government is good, wise and, at least,
                inevitable, and certainly better than other conceiv-
                able alternatives."
    - To share ideology through the majority, the ruling group needs "intellectuals", the majority does not for itself, they just adopt opinions vommited by "intellectuals" 
    - intellectuals get benefits from the state (wealth and prestige), the state uses the intellectuals to form masses way of thinking thus ruling as they want.
        - ex: priests and the state 
    - he claims that in ancient or current states where there is no seperation between state and religion, The head of state is appointed by god thus any negative talk (sometimes even credible talk) is blasphemy.
    - he claims that another way effective way(device as he calls it) is to spread the fear of alternatives, an alternative ruler would be a much worse alternative to the current one.
    - here i'll just quote:
        "The greatest danger to the State
            is independent intellectual criticism; there is no
            better way to stifle that criticism than to attack
            any isolated voice, any raiser of new doubts, as a
            profane violator of the wisdom of his ancestors."
    - Another ideological force used by the state, he claims is the idea of rediculing individual's ideas and exalt the collectivty of society, thus any individual's attempt to change things will be shutdown as a contrary to what the majority wants.
    - he claims that passive resignation which is the belief that state rule is unescapable, is a fertile soil for the state to rule , it is as real as death and taxes(americans would understand).
    - Another way to push away uncovering truth is by framing things as "conspiracy theory" which puts in my head the image of a right wing 50 years old white guy wearing a maga hat who's "life is shit" and who claims that {insert a event  that actually happened but you would have been called a bigot if you questioned it, only for it to be confirmed to have been occured}.
        - putting things in the box of "conspiracy theory" comes in the way of discovering truth.
        - He claims that humans throughout history have tried to prevent absolute power but the rulers often used those attempts to further stregnthen their power, the rulers used religion to rule further, later they used the parliment too.
